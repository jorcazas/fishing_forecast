# models

This module contains implementations of three different models for a fishing prediction system: ARIMA, XGBOOST, and LSTM. Each model has its own script that can be found in the respective subdirectories.

## ARIMA

The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a time series forecasting method that takes into account the autocorrelation and moving average of the data. It is commonly used for predicting future values based on historical patterns.

To explore the ARIMA model implementation, navigate to the `arima.py` script and open the script.

## XGBOOST and LGBM

XGBOOST is an optimized gradient boosting algorithm that is widely used for regression and classification tasks. It is known for its speed and performance, making it a popular choice for predictive modeling.
LGBM is also a gradient boosting algorithm that is commonly used for regression and classification tasks.

To explore the XGBOOST and LGBM model implementation, navigate to the `lgbm_xgboost.py` script and open the script.

## LSTM

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of learning long-term dependencies. It is often used for sequence prediction tasks, such as time series forecasting.

To explore the LSTM model implementation, navigate to the `lstm.py` script and open the script.

# PROPHET 

The Prophet model is a time series forecasting model developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team. It is designed to handle time series data with strong seasonality and multiple trends. The model is particularly useful for forecasting data that exhibits non-linear growth patterns and has missing values or outliers.

To explore the Prophet model implementation, navigate to the `prophet.py` script and open the script.

Feel free to dive into each script to understand the inner workings of these models and how they are applied to the fishing prediction problem.
